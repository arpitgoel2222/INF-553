This time it was actually good. Way better than inn n out. It's the same type of burger that's why I put it up against that. I love that you can get grilled jalape\u00f1os. Just wish they came on the burger and not on the side.", "date": "2015-12-19 07:35:30"}

When it first opened up it was essentially an in n out knock off that was nicknamed flipping mediocre. Which is why when my mind was blown when I walked in here recently and it was completely different. The inside has been remodeled to have more group friendly seating. The menu has also streamlined to be burgers and chicken sandwiches. The food is definitely of a higher quality and you get to choose your heat with the chicken. I will say the Vegas and the Flippin can get pretty hot, so beware before you order. \n\nMy only two gripes with them is that sometimes the wait can get a bit long and you just have to roll with it because it's right in the middle of downtown so that's understandable. My other major issue is that you don't get fries, or any side when you order a burger or sandwich. If I'm paying $9 for a burger, I shouldn't really have to add $4 more for fries or onion rings.", "date": "2018-03-21 01:54:13"}
